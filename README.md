# Andres Ramirez Portfolio:

This is my portfolio where I showcase new skills I have learned in my quest to become a Data Scientist.

## [Project 1: Personal Credit Card Spending Analysis](https://github.com/WarlockBlue/Credit-Card-Spending-Analysis)

In this project I:

- Developed a script to review, extract, and clean the personal credit card spending history using Pandas.
- Created a pivot table to summarize the maximum, average, and total spending per month per year from 2019 to 2021.
- Using the max aggregate function in conjunction to the pivot table, summarized the maximum spending per month per year from 2019 to 2021 only.
- Identified the two largest transactions per month per year from 2019 to 2021 using a simple for loop and the max pivot table.
- Designed a bar plot to map the maximum, average, and total spending per month per year from 2019 to 2021 to clearly visualize credit card spending patterns.
- Narrowed down the scope to the year 2021 and created a barplot with the total spending each month.
- Created a box plot per month for the year 2021 to analyze the spending distribution without outliers.
